# Simple Keylogger

## üìú Project Overview
This **Simple Keylogger** is a Python-based tool that records and logs keystrokes made on a keyboard and saves them to a text file. This project was developed strictly for **educational purposes** to demonstrate how keyloggers work and to raise awareness about potential cybersecurity risks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is for **educational purposes only**. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can be illegal and unethical. Please ensure you have the necessary permissions before using such tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `pynput` library. You can install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install pynput
How to Run:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-keylogger.git
cd simple-keylogger
Install the pynput library:

bash
Copy code
pip install pynput
Run the keylogger:

bash
Copy code
python keylogger.py
‚ú® Usage
Once the keylogger is running, it will record all keystrokes, including special keys like Enter and Space, and save them in a file called keylog.txt.

To stop logging, press the Esc key.
Example:
Run the program using the command python keylogger.py.
Start typing, and your keystrokes will be logged in the file keylog.txt.
Press Esc to stop logging.
üìö How It Works
This project uses the pynput library to monitor and capture keyboard inputs in real-time. Every keystroke is logged and written to a text file. The keylogger runs silently in the background and can be stopped by pressing the Esc key.

üéØ Educational Purpose
The project is designed to help people understand:

How keyloggers can be developed and used (both ethically and maliciously).
The importance of cybersecurity awareness and protecting sensitive data.
How to detect and prevent malicious keylogging activities in the real world.
